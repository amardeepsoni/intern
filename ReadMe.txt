IF forms are not align properly :: Install Crispy Form In Your Environment.

***************What I Use In this?********************

(1)I use django builtin Auth_views For USer creation and Login.
(2)I use Decorator to block the access of Success page without login .
(3)Use url Reqriting(Dynamic url) to pass some values to the view function through link.
(4) I'm failed in using AJAX For Dynamic Product Filtering. I dont Have much idea about that.
    I will learn as i'm a fast learner. 
(5) i also used Crispy forms to align built in Form Structure.
(6) also used logout view and redirect the user to the home page .
